This website presents an interactive Shiny dashboard designed to detect and analyse suspicious communication patterns within the Oceanus maritime environment, particularly around Nemo Reef. By combining visualisations such as daily and hourly communication charts, heat maps, and network graphs, users can easily identify anomalies in communication behaviour that may indicate coordinated or illicit activity. The platform enables analysts to filter data by date and time, uncover temporal shifts, and pinpoint periods of unusual activity.

Beyond temporal analysis, the dashboard reveals the structure of the communication network, highlighting key individuals, isolated actors, and bridging entities that connect different groups. The Messages tab offers a deeper dive into the actual message content, allowing investigators to cross-reference suspicious timelines with the nature of the communications. Ultimately, the website supports maritime authorities in monitoring relationships, uncovering threats, and protecting both marine conservation efforts and legitimate operations around Nemo Reef.
