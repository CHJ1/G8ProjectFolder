## Daily Communication Volume Bar Chart

<img src="image/1.png" alt="1" style="max-width: 100%;"/>

This chart displays the number of communications per day, overlaid with a red dashed trend line. It allows analysts to quickly spot days with unusually high or low activity, as well as to observe overall trends such as gradual increases or decreases in daily volume. A sudden spike or drop may indicate an event or coordinated action that warrants further attention.

## Hourly Communication Volume Bar Chart

<img src="image/2.png" alt="2" style="max-width: 100%;"/>

By aggregating the number of communications by hour across the dataset and plotting a trend line, this chart reveals the typical daily rhythm of communications. Significant deviations from the expected hourly pattern, such as an unusual surge in late-night or early-morning activity, can be a red flag for out-of-pattern behaviour.

## Hourly Communication Heat Map

<img src="image/3.png" alt="3" style="max-width: 100%;"/>

The heat map visualises the intensity of communications for each hour of each day, making it easy to spot recurring peaks or abrupt changes. Consistent high activity during certain hours may be normal, but a shift in these patterns, such as a new peak at an odd hour or an isolated day with unusual activity, can signal suspicious coordination or attempts to evade detection.

Together, these temporal visualisations enable analysts to:

1.  Detect when communication patterns deviate from the established norm.
2.  Pinpoint specific dates and hours where suspicious activity is concentrated.
3.  Observe whether suspicious patterns are isolated incidents or part of a broader trend.

## Communication Network Graph

The communication network graph provides a structural snapshot of the network at any selected date and time. By filtering the network to a specific window (identified as suspicious via the temporal charts), analysts can:

1.  Visualise which entities are most active or central during periods of interest.

2.  Identify clusters, bridges, or unusually dense connections that may indicate coordinated groups or key facilitators.

3.  Assess the scale and reach of the network at critical moments, helping to distinguish between routine communication and orchestrated events.

This graph is essential for understanding not just when, but who is involved in suspicious activity, and how information or influence flows between individuals and organisations.

Date and time slicers have been incorporated at the top right of the dashboard, allowing users to filter all visualisations by date and time. This interactive control enables analysts to dynamically adjust the temporal scope of the data displayed, making it easier to focus on specific periods of interest and observe how communication patterns and network structures change over time

## Deep Dive: The Messages Tab

<img src="image/4.png" alt="4" style="max-width: 100%;"/>

Once a suspicious period is identified through the above visualisations, the messages tab allows for targeted review of the actual message content exchanged during that window. This enables:

1.  Direct examination of the nature and context of communications, confirming whether the content aligns with legitimate business or hints at illicit coordination.

2.  Identification of code words, unusual instructions, or references to sensitive operations.

3.  Verification of relationships and roles among key entities, as messages often reveal hierarchy, influence, and intent.

By correlating message content with network structure and temporal anomalies, analysts can move from pattern detection to concrete evidence gathering, supporting investigations into illegal or unethical activities.

## Louvain Clustering 

This module allows you to explore clusters of entities within the Oceanus communication network using the Louvain community detection algorithm. By doing this, you can identify tightly knit groups, uncover hidden patterns, and support investigation into the communication structure.

Step 1:   

Use the dropdown menu labelled “Select Cluster” at the top of the screen (highlighted in red).

Step 2: 

Once a cluster is selected: 

The graph will highlight the nodes (entities) and edges (connections) belonging to that cluster.

## Infomap Clustering 

To apply the Infomap community detection algorithm on the network data to reveal high-resolution clusters, capturing fine-grained groupings of entities based on their communication patterns and structural positions. 

Step 1:   

Use the dropdown menu labelled “Select Cluster” at the top of the screen (highlighted in red).

Step 2:  

Once a cluster is selected: 

The graph will highlight the nodes (entities) and edges (connections) belonging to that cluster.

## Algorithm Comparison 

The bar plots on this page show: 

- Number of Clusters detected by each algorithm (left chart), helping to understand how granular or coarse each partitioning is. 

- Modularity Score (right chart), which measures the strength of community separation — higher scores indicate better defined, more internally cohesive clusters. 

This helps quickly assess which algorithm creates the most modular, and thus potentially more meaningful, community structure.

## Interactive Performance Analysis 

The summary table presents a side-by-side comparison of algorithms, including: 

- Total number of clusters. 

- Precise modularity values. 

- Automated ranking based on modularity. 

- Qualitative efficiency rating (Excellent, Good, Fair) for intuitive decision support. 

This enables interactive sorting and inspection to see which algorithm is most suitable under varying conditions.
