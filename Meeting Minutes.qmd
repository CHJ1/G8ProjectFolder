## Meeting 1: Ideation & Delegation

Date: 15 May 2025

Attendees: Han Jie, Roy

Key Discussions:

-   Reviewed the overall scope of the mini-challenge and brainstormed possible analytical directions.

-   Decided to split work by question areas:
Han Jie:
Q1: Exploratory Analysis
Q3: Communication Pattern Analysis

Roy:
Q2: Interactive Network Visualisation, Algorithm Rankings & Interpretation


-   Agreed to use consistent R packages: tidygraph, ggraph, visNetwork for both analysis and visualization, referencing lessons on network analysis and interactive techniques.

Action Items:

-   Each member to begin work on their assigned questions.

-   Dataset to be obtained and confirmed via eLearn submission.

## Meeting 2: Code Integration & Standardisation

Date: 31 May 2025

Attendees: Han Jie, Roy

Key Discussions:

-   Reviewed initial individual progress on respective questions.

-   Standardised:
Data cleaning scripts (ensuring node and edge tables have consistent IDs and attributes, filtering out redundant edges).
Function calls and plotting themes for reproducibility.

-   Discussed technical issues (e.g., code errors, dataset compatibility) and supported each other in debugging.

Decisions:

-   Han Jie: To consolidate Q1 & Q3 outputs into a unified exploratory summary.

-   Roy: To build modular functions for network metrics and interactive visualisation, ensuring the Shiny app can integrate additional inputs easily.

Action Items:

-   Continue module development and resolve any integration issues.

-   Share code and outputs via Netlify and internal file sharing.

## Meeting 3: Poster & Shiny App Presentation

Date: 28 June 2025

Attendees: Han Jie, Roy

Key Discussions:

-   Finalized poster layout:
Left panel: Exploratory & communication pattern analysis (Q1 & Q3).
Right panel: Interactive network insights (Q2), with rankings and key influence metrics highlighted.

-   Discussed Shiny app enhancements:
Node filtering by role/group for easier insight exploration.
Hover tooltips and algorithm toggle (centrality/community results).
Dataset upload capability for graders to test scenarios.

-   Coordinated on user guide, poster, and minutes deliverables.

Decisions:

-   Han Jie to lead on Shiny application and project website.

-   Roy to focus on poster and meeting minutes.

-   Both to review each other's modules for consistency and integration before final submission.

Action Items:

-   Complete and review all deliverables (poster, user guide, meeting minutes, website).

-   Submit final project by 29 June 2025.
